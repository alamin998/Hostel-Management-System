# Hostel-Management-System

A complete solution to manage each and every detail of a hostel.
The Hostel Management System project is designed to manage all hostel activities such as admissions, fees, room assignments, mess allotment and hostel stores as well as provide relevant data for smooth transactions. It’s also used to keep track of monthly mess bills, hostel staff salary and student certificates, among other things.
During the development of this project we’ve collected data via google form, what kind of feature general people want. We have tried to fulfill most of the desire of the hostel requirements but due to lack of time some of the requirements were solved.
The admin can save record of total number of students in the hostel, information about their faculty and course of study. We have also attached the form to keep simple record of the teachers.
The system is totally secure with password protected facility. The administrator can create new user, update then when required and delete them if necessary. The administrator staff can utilize all the facility provided by the software and all the guest staff can get some of the facility.
This software also provides the facility to create backup of the database which will help to retrieve data when the accidental loss in the original database happen.

Speed optimization-

As with many scripting languages, PHP scripts are normally kept as human-readable source code, even on production web servers.

Functions-
